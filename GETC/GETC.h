/* 
  "GETC" Interface for byte input (i.e. started as a wrapper for getc())

	For image- and video decoders I needed a transparent mechanism for 
	opening and reading the input data: 

		- either from streams (eg. coded video)
		- or preloaded into memory (eg. small GIF/PNG images)

	RAINBOW is only dependent on the GETC Interface for byte input. 

	File stream input is used during development and testing (FILEGETC.C). 
	In the OS image Rainbow can be linked with MEMGETC.C for memory input. 
	No other changes necessary in RAINBOW.
