/**********************************************************************************
*  
*   Scaled Integer 1-D IDCT based on the LLM-method that 
*   reduces the number of multiplications from 11 to to 6. 
*   Here further reduced to 3 using some dyadic decomposition. 
*  
*   The real scaling vector: 
*     v[0] = v[4] = 1.0;
*     v[2] = beta;
*     v[6] = alpha;
*     v[5] = v[3] = theta*M_SQRT2;
*     v[1] = v[7] = theta;
*  
*   The integer scaling matrix is derived as SCALEM = [v vt] << 12.
